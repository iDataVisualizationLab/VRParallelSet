# TitanicVR: Data Visualization of Titanic Datasets
Website: https://lvrg12.github.io/TitanicVR/

## Description

This application is intended to visualize stacked graphs through distinct graph settings and visualization techniques. The application allows for an educated comparison between these multiple settings, as well as a comparison between the provided visualization methods and other common graph representation, such as 2D charts.

## Objective

The application provides multiple graph visualization settings and 2 visualization modes: 3D and VR. The objective is to represent the dataset in the best way possible such that the user can gather the most useful and meaningful information in a comfortable manner.

## Related Work

The application was largely based on the Stacked Parallel Coordinate Plot described by Dr. Tommy Dang. Other resources were used to model the graph structure. One of these was Parallel Sets by Jason Davies. The Titanic dataset is also from Davies work. Known graph designs were used, such as Hive plots and Steam graphs.
